### 🚨 **What We Learned (What NOT to Do)**

#### **❌ Aggressive File Cleanup**
- **NEVER** delete working files during "cleanup" without thorough testing
- **ALWAYS** test functionality after any file reorganization
- **BACKUP** working state before making structural changes

#### **❌ Over-Engineering Solutions**
- **AVOID** complex dynamic systems when simple static works
- **DON'T** break working functionality to add "advanced" features
- **KEEP** it simple and functional over complex and broken

#### **❌ Premature Optimization**
- **DON'T** create JSON-based systems before confirming they're needed
- **AVOID** adding complexity before understanding user requirements
- **FOCUS** on core functionality first, enhancements second

#### **❌ Breaking Changes Without Testing**
- **ALWAYS** test after major changes
- **NEVER** assume "cleanup" won't break functionality
- **VALIDATE** that all features work before considering task complete
